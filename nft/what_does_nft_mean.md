# What does NFT mean?

Non-Fungible Token

Here is the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token)

But what does it _mean_?.

And _meaning_ is the key here.

What does it _mean_ to _own_ something?

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ownership)

```
Ownership is the state or fact of exclusive rights and control over property...
```

What is [property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property)?

```
Property (latin: Res Privata) in the abstract is what belongs to or with something...
```

Did you question my use of wikipedia to provide meaning to those words?

I doubt it.

This is because wikipedia has become
[_legitimate_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimacy_(political)>).

```
In political science, legitimacy is the right and acceptance of an authority...
```

Once upon a time that was not so. I remember that time, and that time has
passed. We now live in the age of wikipedia as a legitimate source of knowledge.

The important thing to note with wikipedian legitimacy is that it didn't happen
all at once. It accumulated. Slowly, article by article, mind by mind until
suddenly (seemingly overnight) the balance of
[_authority_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority) changed.

```
In the fields of sociology and political science, authority is the legitimate power that a person or a group of persons consensually possess and practice over other people.
```

In 2021 can one _afford_ to question the legitimate authority of wikipedia as a
source of knowledge?

In 2021 is it affordable to continue to question the legitimacy of
cryptocurrencies as a means of ownership?

For many I believe the tipping point will be seen as
[Beeple's $69 million art sale](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-auction-christie-s-nft/digital-only-artwork-fetches-nearly-70-million-at-christies-idUSKBN2B3275)
at
[Christies](https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/beeple-first-5000-days/beeple-b-1981-1/112924).

In my mind that was something of a 'moon landing' event. Can't go back to
before. The world is a different place now.

The monetary amount in this case is important in that it made a sensational
story, but the fact that _Christies_ legitimized the transaction is _crucial_.

For years it has been possible to (and people have) traded NFTs and NFT-like
contracts using blockchain transactions.

For those keeping up with this technology, this is _old_ news.

And _old_ is also part of the key here. As in _old people_.

Thomas Kuhn famously coined the phrase
['paradigm shift'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift).

```
A paradigm shift, a concept identified by the American physicist and philosopher Thomas Kuhn, is a fundamental change in the basic concepts and experimental practices of a scientific discipline
```

In the book
[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions)
Kuhn made the sad discovery that scientists _hold on_, to beliefs they formed
early in their lives, and _dont'_ change their minds on core principles as new
evidence and theories form. Science advances largely only as the old scientists
die, and are replaced by the next generation who aren't locked into the old ways
of thinking.

This isn't to _blame_ those scientists. Scientists are after all human, and the
human mind seems to work in such a way as to _fix_ ones view of the world early
in life.

That being said, it is today widely recognized that the Earth travels around the
Sun, and Quatum Mechanics is legit science. Remember, Einstein famously thought
QM was 'spooky', and challenged it, even though he opened the door for it with
his previous work. This isn't about intellectual capability, it's about human
psychology.

## What does it mean to _own_ something?

I _own_ a vehicle. It sits in my garage.

If someone were to break my garage door down and run away with my vehicle would
I still _own_ it?

In a way, yes. If it was ever recovered I could claim it as mine. And during the
time of its loss I would certainly _feel_ as though I was the legitimate owner.

But during the time when _my_ vehicle was being driven by the thief, in practice
the thief has greater ownership of the vehicle in that they have _possession_ of
it.

So what makes the vehicle mine or the property of the thief?

In practical terms, it is the ability to maintain _control_ over the property
over time.

The thief, as they are able to continue to drive around with my car (maybe they
are clever and give it a new paint job and fake license plate) will feel as if
_they_ own the vehicle (and will no doubt be annoyed if it is stolen from them
in turn).

However, in the eyes of _the law and society_ I would still be the owner if/when
the vehicle was ever to be discovered. My _symbolic_ ownership _trumps_ the
temporary physical ownership in the long term. There are even special sub-groups
within society often called called 'police' that will carry out physical
enforcement of this symbolic ownership. This a _key benefit_ of living in a
society vs as a lone wonderer, and why humans have done so for thousands of
years. I recommend it, and I'm not aware of any humans alive today that have a
choice but to be a member of such a society.

This symbolic ownership is done via a system of record keeping. Honda, created
the vehicle, and with it a unique identifier (called a
[VIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_identification_number)) that they
stamped on the frame. They then sold the vehicle/VIN to a dealer who sold it to
me. It is the ownership of the VIN (the number, not the thing stamped into the
frame) that makes the vehicle _mine_. For cars, ownership is NOT the physical
possession of the hunk of glass and steel, it is owning a number.

Here I will interject to make the claim that mathematical locks and keys are
stronger than any physical lock and key, and likely always will be. It is
certainly stronger than any lock and key that currently protects any of my
physical possessions. I believe most would protect their possesions with such
locks and keys if they were able.

VINs and deeds work for houses and cars, and no reasonable person questions it.

## What does it mean to _own_ something in the digital world? Is that even possible?

Yes. In fact I would claim that is how the _majority_ of ownership and human
existence happens in the modern era.

Humans _already_ live in a non-physical world for the most part.

I would argue that
[Social Constructs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructionism) are
largely what humans live within.

```
A social construct or construction is the meaning, notion, or connotation placed on an object or event by a society, and adopted by the inhabitants of that society with respect to how they view or deal with the object or event.
```

Examples:

- Is money physical?

- Where is the physical _body_ of a corporation?

- What invisible hand touches most adults causing them to leave their beds and
  houses roughly at the same time each the morning (for 5 of the 7 days of the
  week (what an odd cycle)). Causing them to leave friends and loved ones, to
  spend most of their precious time _working_ for a goals they largely do not
  understand, or perhaps even agree with, voluntarily?

Just as it would have been laughable for a caveman to recognize my 'ownership'
of my home when I signed a piece of paper...it is laughable to many today to
recognize 'ownership' of an item on the blockchain, signed by a cryptographic
function (which is much, much harder to forge). But is it so different?

There are no more cavemen left alive. Their children inhereted the Earth upon
which we all stand today. Those children grow up and have 'crazy' ideas that are
no longer crazy, because all those that thought they were crazy have passed on.
Crazy 'paper-signing' vs good old-fashioned 'I beat you with club if I see you
take' is today the normal means of signifying ownership.

The idea of ownership, especially expensive item ownership, is already largely
symbolic. I have a very few _personal_ possessions that I would physically fight
for, and physically protect using my own two hands.

My most _expensive_ possessions (house, vehicle, banking account, etc...) are
_already_ 'owned' in a purely symbolic way, that my caveman ancestors would not
recognize as legitimate, but _most_ alive today (thankfully) would.

The question then in my mind becomes _when_ not _if_ cryptocurrencies/NFTs will
become the dominant means of symbolizing ownership for humanity.

I do think it will take time. The old will need to pass on, as I don't think
they will accept such a large change. But as they pass, their children will (I
think) prefer the speed, safety, efficiency and just raw power to be had by
owning via blockchain vs the current archaic systems we have today (_cough_
title insurance _cough_).

## So what do NFTs mean _today_?

#1 They aren't going away. This isn't a fad. This is the new normal coming into
being.

#2 NFTs _democratizes_ cryptocurrencies in the same way that the internet
democratized news reporting and entertainment. There will be a lot of trash and
spam, especially in the begining. But the sheer _volume_ of creativity,
opportunities, and just plain human potential that can be unlocked by this
change, will far far outweigh the chaff.

#3 Remember the 2000s internet, and how that led to the world today where the
internet is _everything_? This is the 2000s of cryptocurrency.

## Particularly neat things about NFTs

- Fractional ownership of more-or-less anything. This is important for the same
  reason that corporations sell millions of _shares_ of stock: liquidity. The
  universal grease of economics. The gears of economics are going to start
  turning at [ludicrous speeds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygE01sOhzz0)

- Original creators of a good can benifit from all grey-market sales. Token
  contracts can be written in ways that _mandate in code_ that a portion of the
  sale goes back to the original creator whenever a token is transferred. Quite
  attractive if one is selling a good that is likely to trade hands over time.
  Think 'my own private sales tax'. A huge incentive for goods producers to do
  what they can to _increase_ the value of their old goods _after_ the sale.
  Crazy talk.

- The owners of a creator's work can now directly benifit from supporting the
  artist over the span of their career, for a wider variety of artforms such as
  music and games. Suddenly having a keen eye of an up and coming talent and
  supporting them by buying their music, game, blogpost, tweet, etc. can reap
  real rewards down the line, if that creator 'takes off'. A used t-shirt isn't
  going to sell for much, and today there is no way to resell an mp3 from
  iTunes, but an NFT of an early mp3 NFT bought from the artist early in their
  career could be worth quite a bit. This encourages everyone to be on the
  lookout for new talent, and more importantly to _financially support new
  talent_ as long as one sees _potential_. It also encourages _all creators_ to
  be as creative and produce as much as they can, and 'sell cheap' early in
  their careers without stigma (remember how the grey market sales work).

- A provenance system for art that makes it _trivial_ to verify ownership over
  large spans of time (hundreds, perhaps thousands of years (maybe much
  longer)). Longer than most physical art is likely to stand up to the ravages
  of time, and importantly with _zero_ storage costs. IMHO This is why Beeple's
  jpg sold for $69 million. This is the core of why the rich buy art. To store
  and preserve _long term_ wealth. Anything that would knock out the blockchain
  at this point would likely end humanity first. "The First 5000 Days" has real
  potential to outlast the Mona Lisa (which has almost been destroyed several
  times by vandals over the years). The rich have spoken, and it looks like they
  are voting for NFTs (and for solid reasons, nobody gives 60+ million to a
  relatively unknown artist on a lark).

- The value of any NFT token is _independent_ of the value of the blockchain,
  which can swing widely day to day. That is 101 of what an NFT is, and is in a
  sense its 'killer feature'. Value of an NFT is purely in the hands/minds of
  the market for that _particular_ NFT, regardless as the price of the
  underlying blockchain. This means one can have confidence that what one _owns_
  will _retain_ its value as long as the thing itself is valueable. One isn't
  betting on if Ethereum will hold value. One is betting on if the artist, song,
  image, game item, etc... will hold, which is a much easier thing to reason
  about and understand (one generally knows a thing or two about the things one
  chooses to purchase). Few understand the details of the vast and complex
  systems underlying the Visa payment network, but everyone knows what kind of
  music, books, and and games they like.

## How to take advantage

It is hard to predict what exactly will win as 'everything changes' again, but I
think _exposure_ and smartly embracing change vs recoiling and rejecting is an
overall winning strategy.

Don't be afraid to loose. Loosing is part of learning, and few gains come
without at least some losses.

Be a bit afraid. This _will_ bring change and disruption. Think about what will
happen as people move away from those social constructs around ownership one may
presently hold dear towards new ones that seem indecipherable, and foreign.

Be a bit excited. As the old trees die they leave room for new growth. Striving
for that new light can be lot of fun.

Reach out if you have questions. I've been following the cryptocurrency space
for about a decade, and am happy to share my perspective to those just arriving.
