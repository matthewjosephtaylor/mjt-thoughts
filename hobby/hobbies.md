It occurs to me that I need to be more sincere in my hobby pursuing.

This ocurred to me while watching
[a random woodworking video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVb3OPZrrVc)

I'm drawn to these kinds of video series where the practitioner goes through the
process of whatever it is they are doing. This one in particular sparked my
interest because the videos are mostly centered around the building of the
'shop'. The progression of how the shop expands over time gives a sense of 'do
thing the thing to improve doing the thing'.

There is something soothing about watching the process.
