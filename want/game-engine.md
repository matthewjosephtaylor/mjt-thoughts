# What I want in a Game Engine

The ability to _easily_ and _effortlessly_ assemble a game that _I_ want to
play.

Basic game development from start to finish should be no more than a 1 day
effort. End of the day should be a playable fun and complete game that is
suitable for release.

Games can be endlessly polished. It is fun to polish any object that one loves.
Polishing is a joy in itself.

Polishing is a _separate_ effort from game development. The _game_ is the core and is simple. The polishing hangs from the core and can be as complex and take as long as desired.

The engine is _separate_ from the game.

Games are _configuration_ of the engine. Games are entirely _data_ (even the
game bits that have logic).

A good game engine provides a _simple_ and _clean_ interface between itself and
the game. As the engine evolves it MUST remain capable of running previous games
with no change in the game. A game engine is an 'operating system' for the game. One _learns_ a game engine. It is the constant in the endless sea of games one produces.

A game engine is NOT an editor. Editors need to be tuned to their specific content. Embeding an editor in a game is a mistake akin to embedding any application software into an OS. It stagnates and removes focus.

A game engine MUST provide clear and useful information on how the game is running 'behind the scenes'. Error and metric information is the _primary_ reason for the engine's existence.
