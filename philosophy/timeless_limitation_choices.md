# Timeless Limitation

I feel demotivated whenever I think of writing code to automate something that can change over time.

For instance:
- ad-blocker for facebook ads
- chrome extension that filters 'evil' headers like CORS, x-frame-options, and report-to

On the other hand there is deep satisfaction with writing code that solves a problem 'forever'.

- math library
- color conversion library

Automation is limiting the choice of _how_ to do something. It is artful in that it creates a _particular_ solution to the problem. It is a new tool in the toolbox that is shaped a particular way. A hammer has many unique shapes that can solve the problem of driving a nail.

I'm not interested in creating fragile hammers made of materials that degrade over time.

I want to create a _solid_ hammer made of as-near-industructable material as I have access to.

## Data vs Functions

Data is timeless.
Impure Functions are timefull.
Pure Functions are timeless

I create data structures

I create wrappers around imperfect tools that use data structures.

The focus is on better and better data structures.
