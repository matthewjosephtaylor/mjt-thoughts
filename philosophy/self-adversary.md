# Play chess with yourself

Adversaries in a sense cooperate.

They are both playing the same game. Worshiping the same god from opposite sides.

White and black both serve contrast.

Adversaries _use_ the other. They need and _depend_ upon the other.

By playing both sides within oneself, one is striving to achieve a greater appreciation of some goal by stretching oneself to cover a wider area.

Having another entity as an adversary is not always convenient/possible. Opponents are not always available.

Having easy access to the mindset of one's opponent can lead to more subtle strategies.
