The life of art

--- Artification of mechanics ---

I've been having a lot of relaxing fun with the art lately.

I have a work-pattern that keeps me busy and engaged throughout the day.

I'm considering adding some game mechanics into the art. Spice it up a bit.

Weird that I think of it that way now. 180 of where I started from.

--- Physical ---

I note that since I've dropped the 'normal' schedule that I've dropped a few lbs
this week. I attribute this to being more intuned with eating when I'm hungry,
vs eating on a schedule.

I'm suspecting that a daily schedule to life is perhaps unhealthy. Perhaps it
chaffs against natural rhythms.

It could also be that I've switched from cheese to avocados to flesh out my
meals.

Or maybe it is the additional coffee?

Whatever, it seems to be going well, and so I'll keep going in this direction.

--- Mental ---

The art is nice, but I do note that it isn't as challenging as being more
actively engaged in focused programming projects.

I'm less frustrated and more calm/relaxed, but there is a certain dimension to
deeper challenges that I note I'm missing.

--- Thanks ---

I appreciate those who are continuing to be with me as I stumble around in life.
Perhaps I'll get my act together at some point...but for now I must stumble, and
I'm grateful for those who are watching out for me, and continuing to help guide
me.
