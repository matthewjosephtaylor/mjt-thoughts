Art is Life

--- Art ---

What do I do with each day that I've been gifted?

Recently the art production has taken over my creative needs.

Perhaps I'm smelling the roses in my garden while Rome burns. I have several
other creative pursuits that I'm not spending time on.

Creativity, I'm discovering, is a hunger that can be satisfied in a variety of
ways. As long as I do several hours of day of some form of purposeful practice,
that is all my well-being appears to require.

There really is, of course, nothing that needs to be done. My only concern is to
appreciate the day as fully as I'm capable. So I'm happy with my present
pursuit, but I'm also constantly questioning. I'm also happy with the
questioning, which will no doubt lead me into some other pursuits eventually.

--- Thanks ---

I hope everyone reading this is well. I invite you to smell the roses with me,
or to have fun fighting those vandals. Either way, I hope you are enjoying this
beautiful moment.

💕 🙏
