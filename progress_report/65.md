Progress Report #65

I code therefore I am

--- Routines Lead to Boredom ---

For the past couple of months I've allowed myself to indulge in art.

The programming I did was to serve the art, and was not particularly 'deep' most days. More tweaking and refactoring, though there was some intersting bits (I finally came to grips with javascript workers).

I also think I've come into deeper contact with with my love of art.

This week I decided to put the art asside and to get back into game development.

It was a good decision.

Like how shifting position in a chair makes one realize that they had become stiff and sore without realizing it. 

The simple act of _change_ feels good. It was time for a change.

--- Stepping Away Leads to Perspective ---

I've been struggling with game development for over a year now. 

It has been a good struggle.

As I start again once more from 'scratch', I find that I'm enjoying the process even more.

Each time I come back I'm starting from a more capable position. That is a good feeling.

--- Thanks ---

Each week I'm able to continue down this path is a gift. I do my best not to take it for granted. Each day, each breath is something special to behold. As is each of my friends who might be reading this, that I cherish and hold special in my heart.
